# Postman-User-Collection
This is an example user collection where we can add a user, retriever user, update user and then delete with java script assertions in postman and all these requests are chained.
Just import this API collection.json and Envirnonment collection.json file into postman and use the latest authorisation code from the source website and then run these collections using collection runner or run through via Jenkins using newman cli integration
