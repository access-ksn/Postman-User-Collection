# Postman-User-Collection
This is an example user collection where we can add a user, retriever user, update user and then delete with java script assertions in postman and all these requests are chained.
Just import this API collection and Envirnonment collection into postman and use the latest authorisation code from the source website and then run to using collection runner.
